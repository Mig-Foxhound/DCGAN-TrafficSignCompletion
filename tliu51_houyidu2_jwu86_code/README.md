# DCGAN-TrafficSignCompletion
To run the code, you need to install python3, jupyter notebook and pytorch.
This instruction is for MAC computers only. 

(1) Open the terminal, use command:
    python3 -m pip install jupyter
    pip3 install torch torchvision

    
(2) Open the jupyter notebook by:
    jupyter notebook
    
(3ï¼‰Go to the folder, open DCGAN_Image_Completion.ipynb
    
(4) We have already trained on Google cloud platform and store the trained weights in the folder, so just skip the cells related to training. More details please see commemts in the code.

(5) The image dataset might be too large to upload to compass 2g. If that happened, all the data files can be found on github:
